## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### For Each Task:

1. **Read the Task File**
   - Open the task file (e.g., `task_01_basic_classes.py`)
   - Read the requirements carefully
   - Understand what you need to build

2. **Try to Solve It Yourself**
   - Write your solution in the same file (after the instructions)
   - Test your code thoroughly
   - Try to complete it without looking at the solution

3. **Test Your Solution**
   ```bash
   python task_01_basic_classes.py
   ```

4. **If You Get Stuck**
   - Review the concepts in the task description
   - Try to debug your code
   - Google specific errors or concepts
   - Only then, check the solution file

5. **Check the Solution**
   - After completing (or if stuck), review the solution
   - Compare your approach with the provided solution
   - Read the detailed comments and explanations
   - Run the solution to see expected output:
   ```bash
   python solutions/solution_01_basic_classes.py
   ```

6. **Learn from the Solution**
   - Understand WHY the solution works
   - Note any different approaches
   - Read the "KEY TAKEAWAYS" section
   - Try to implement the concepts in a new small program

## 📖 Concepts Covered

### Core OOP Principles
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods, hiding internal details
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones
- **Polymorphism**: Same interface, different implementations
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity, showing only essentials

### Python-Specific Features
- Class and instance variables
- `self` and `cls` parameters
- `@property`, `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod` decorators
- Magic/Dunder methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, etc.)
- Multiple inheritance and Method Resolution Order (MRO)
- Abstract Base Classes (ABC module)
- Composition vs Inheritance

### Design Patterns
- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Composition over Inheritance

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't Rush**: Take your time with each task. Understanding is more important than speed.

2. **Type, Don't Copy**: Even when looking at solutions, type the code yourself. This builds muscle memory.

3. **Experiment**: Try modifying the solutions. What happens if you change something?

4. **Use the REPL**: Test small pieces of code in Python's interactive shell.

5. **Break Problems Down**: If a task seems overwhelming, break it into smaller pieces.

6. **Make Mistakes**: Errors are learning opportunities. Read error messages carefully.

7. **Draw Diagrams**: For inheritance and composition, drawing class diagrams helps.

8. **Teach Someone**: Try explaining the concepts to someone else (or a rubber duck!).

## 🧪 Testing Your Code

Each solution file includes comprehensive tests. You can:

1. Run individual task files:
   ```bash
   python task_01_basic_classes.py
   ```

2. Run solution files to see expected output:
   ```bash
   python solutions/solution_01_basic_classes.py
   ```

3. Compare your output with the solution output

## 🤝 Getting Help

If you're stuck:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check the task requirements again
3. Review the concepts section in the task file
4. Google the specific concept or error
5. Check the solution file in the `solutions/` folder
6. Try to understand WHY the solution works, not just WHAT it does

## 🏆 Challenge Yourself

After completing a task, try these challenges:

- **Extend the functionality**: Add new features to the solution
- **Optimize the code**: Make it more efficient or cleaner
- **Add error handling**: Make it more robust
- **Write tests**: Create unit tests for your classes
- **Combine concepts**: Use multiple concepts in one program
