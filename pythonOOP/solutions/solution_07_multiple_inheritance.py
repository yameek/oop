"""
SOLUTION 7: Multiple Inheritance and MRO
=========================================

CONCEPTS EXPLAINED:
-------------------
1. Multiple Inheritance: Class inherits from multiple parent classes
2. MRO (Method Resolution Order): Order Python searches for methods
3. C3 Linearization: Algorithm Python uses for MRO
4. Diamond Problem: When multiple paths lead to same base class
5. super(): Follows MRO, not just immediate parent
6. __mro__: Attribute showing the method resolution order
