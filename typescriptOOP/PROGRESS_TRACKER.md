# TypeScript OOP Progress Tracker

Use this worksheet to mark off tasks, capture insights, and plan follow-ups as you work through the TypeScript OOP series.

## How to Use
- Check off tasks as you complete them.
- Track time, perceived difficulty, and key takeaways.
- Note questions to revisit or topics to reinforce.
- Tailor the "Key concepts" checklist to your learning.
